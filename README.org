*This is a fork I'm hacking on to get working. I don't really recommend using it at this stage.*

Ox-zola is an Org exporter backend that streamlines Emacs users' conversion from Org mode to Markdown, caring for both the body and the TOML frontmatter in a way that's compatible with [[https://www.getzola.org/][the static site generator Zola]].

It started as a fork of the famous =ox-hugo= exporter, but it now is a different package that runs on top of =ox-hugo= itself.

This way, you can receive =ox-hugo= updates without being restrained by the progress of this package.
Even so, *I suggest pinning* =ox-hugo= to the most recent working version to avoid breaking changes after updates.
# Having a dedicated package with a different name is also helpful to let Zola users find this solution.

Being this package built like a layer on top of =ox-hugo=, most of the stuff you can do with =ox-hugo= is possible with =ox-zola= too; so, I suggest reading the [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo documentation]] to have a grasp of how the entire exporter works.

#+begin_quote
Usually, people use a single static site generator, but if you have different websites that happen to be generated with Zola and Hugo, you're covered. =ox-zola= doesn't break =ox-hugo=!

If something doesn't go the right way, remember that you can open an issue and we can work together for solving the problem. Enhancement requests are appreciated too.

* Installation

** emacs
Since this package was born for my personal use and it's not perfect yet, I didn't make it available on Melpa.
However, you can install it directly from this repository.

Install with =straight=:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(ox-zola :host github :repo "gicrisf/ox-zola"
   :files (:defaults "*.el" "backend" "stylesheets")
   :includes ox-hugo))
#+end_src

Install with use-package:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ox-zola
    :ensure t
    :config
    (require 'ox-hugo))
#+end_src

If you're on Doom Emacs like me, you can install with the =package!= macro:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Remember, org-hugo is required
(package! ox-hugo)
(package! ox-zola :recipe (:host github :repo "gicrisf/ox-zola"))
#+end_src

** needed shortcodes
